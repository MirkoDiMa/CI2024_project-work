2025-01-23 10:45:03,Selection strategy changed from elitist to tournament | Reason: Low diversity detected
2025-01-23 10:45:03,Mutation strategy changed from simple to subtree | Reason: Low diversity (<3)
2025-01-23 10:45:03,Crossover strategy changed from one_point to uniform | Reason: Low diversity (<0.5)
2025-01-23 10:45:03,Local_search strategy changed from simulated_annealing to tabu_search | Reason: Low diversity (<3)
